This repository contains the source code for reproducing the figures in Finn et al. 2024 (paper link to be added soon).

### The File/Folder descriptions are as follows

+ <u>**Helpers.R:**</u> This file contains all the helper functions needed for preparing the visualisations and is referenced by the `Code for figures.R` and `Model coefficients.R` files. The code requires the latest versions (in 2024) of the following R packages and running this file would automatically install/update them
  - `DImodelsVis`
  - `DImodels` 
  - `MASS` 
  - `ggpubr`
  - `tidyverse` 
  - `PieGlyph` 
  - `gridExtra` 
  - `gtable` 
  - `rstudioapi` 
  - `nlme` 
  - `cowplot`
+ <u>**Code for figures.R:**</u> The main code for creating all the figures in the paper and supplementary material. The code takes about 20-30 minutes to run completely and would store the created visualisations in `Figures` folder with the corresponding names as in the paper.
+ <u>**Model Coefficients.R:**</u> The code for creating the table of model coefficients (Table S2 from supplementary material). This coefficients table would be stored as a pdf file called `Table S2.pdf` in the `Figures` folder.
+ <u>**Figures Folder:**</u> The folder containing the created resources after running the code in `Code for figures.R` and `Model coefficients.R` files.
